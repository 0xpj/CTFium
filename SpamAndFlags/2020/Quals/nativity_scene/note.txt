Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to exploit this tiny proof-of-concept JavaScript engine, called v8, that I wrote for a high-school assignment. I removed some stuff to make it more interesting and added an innocent little command-line flag, --allow-natives-syntax, to make it easier on you. See the build.sh file for helpful information.
