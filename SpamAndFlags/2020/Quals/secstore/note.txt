Today we are glad to announce that our bug reward program is extended to cover our latest secure storage technology. We are so confident in the security of our product that we are releasing everything a bounty hunter might need for a successful audit.

Currently we cannot offer monetary rewards, but in the unlikely event of a successful submission we will recognize you in our bulletin. Furthermore, once management approves, we will reward you with t-shirts, stickers, mugs and similar AWESOME swag. Happy hunting!
